# portainer_installers
Scripts to install docker and portainer
All these scripts do is install docker and portianrer. Got this Iedea from @Novaspirit
Docker install script is a copy from his. This is more a less something im hosting so i dont need to keep going back to the websites to install it. 

This is a fork or copy whatever you want to call it from Novaspirit. Just made this on my end so i dont need to navigate to his page all the time. 

```
git clone https://github.com/joshmross/portainer_installers.git
```

```
cd portainer_installers\
chmod +x  docker_install.sh && chmod +x portainer_install.sh  
```

```
chmod +x portainer_update\
bash portainer_update 
```

The last part needs only be ran when portainer has an update and you want to update. If no need to update no need to run. Just there to make it easier. 

## Then run the commands.
